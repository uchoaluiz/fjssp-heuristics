# Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP)
This repository contains the final project for the course Heuristics and Metaheuristics. \
The goal of this project is to solve the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) using the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic.\
The implemented algorithm aims to efficiently explore the solution space and find near-optimal schedules for complex job shop scenarios with flexibility in machine assignments.
