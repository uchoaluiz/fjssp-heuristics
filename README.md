# üõ†Ô∏è Final Project - EPD048: Heuristics and Metaheuristics

---

## üìò Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the course **EPD048 - Heuristics and Metaheuristics**, focusing on solving the **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP)** ‚Äî also known as the **Job Shop Problem with Parallel Machines**.

---

## üß© Problem Description

The **FJSSP** is a complex combinatorial optimization problem where each operation can be processed on one of several machines, introducing flexibility in routing. The challenge lies in selecting the machine for each operation and scheduling the operations to minimize the overall makespan.

---

## üß† Implemented Approaches

This project explores two main strategies:

- **Modified Shifting Bottleneck Procedure (SBP)**:  
  A classical approach for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), adapted here to better accommodate the flexibility of FJSSP. The method first assigns machines to operations, transforming the FJSSP into a JSSP instance, which is then solved using the SBP.

- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**:  
  A metaheuristic technique integrated with the SBP to enhance solution quality by escaping local optima and exploring the solution space more effectively.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Software Engineering Practices

The codebase is designed with **robustness**, **modularity**, and **scalability** in mind:

- Developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles
- Structured for **readability** and **maintainability**
- Follows **best practices** in software engineering to ensure production-readiness

## üöÄ How to Run

To execute the tool, use the `main.py` script with the following command-line arguments:

```bash
python main.py -i path/to/instance.txt -m both -t 60 -salog N -sbplog N
```

### üî∏ **Available Arguments**

**`-i` / `--instance`**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Path to the input file containing the FJSSP instance.

**`-m` / `--method`**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution method to be used. Options:  
- `'cbc'` ‚Äì solves the problem using the CBC solver  
- `'SA'` ‚Äì applies Simulated Annealing  
- `'both'` ‚Äì runs both approaches for comparison

**`-t` / `--timelimit`**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limit in seconds for solving the problem (default: 300 seconds)

**`-salog` / `--salogwriting`**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable or disable detailed logs for Simulated Annealing:  
- `'Y'` ‚Äì write SA logs to `salog.log`  
- `'N'` ‚Äì do not write SA logs (default behavior)

**`-sbplog` / `--sbplogwriting`**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable or disable detailed logs for the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure:  
- `'Y'` ‚Äì write SBP logs to `sbplog.log`  
- `'N'` ‚Äì do not write SBP logs (default behavior)


---

## üìÑ Instance Format  

Each instance consists of:  
- First line: `<number of jobs> <number of machines>`
- Then one line per job: `<number of operations>` and then, for each operation, `<number of machines for this operation>` and for each machine, a pair `<machine> <processing time>`.
- Machine index starts at 0.

### üîπ Example:  

```plaintext
2 3                             # 2 jobs, 3 machines

2 2 0 1 1 2 1 1 3               # job 0: 2 ops | 1st op: 2 eligible machines (p_m0 = 1, p_m1 = 2) | 2nd op: 1 eligible machine (p_m1 = 3)
3 2 0 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 2 4     # job 1: 3 ops | 1st op: 2 eligible machines (p_m0 = 2, p_m2 = 1) | 2nd op: 1 eligible machine (p_m1 = 2) | 3rd op: 2 eligible machines (p_m1 = 3, p_m2 = 4)
```

## üìù Execution Logs

The system produces structured log files to help monitor the behavior and performance of different components. There are three main types of logs:

- **`execlog.log`**  
  Always enabled. This file captures high-level execution information of the entire pipeline, including instance loading, method selection, runtime, and summary statistics.

- **`salog.log`** *(optional)*  
  Stores detailed logs related to the **Simulated Annealing** process ‚Äî including temperature changes, acceptance decisions, diversification levels, and neighborhood statistics.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disabled by default** for performance reasons. To enable it, pass `'Y'` to the `-salog` or `--salogwriting` argument.

- **`sbplog.log`** *(optional)*  
  Stores detailed logs of each **Shifting Bottleneck Procedure (SBP)** call ‚Äî including machine-level schedules, critical paths, and bottleneck resolution steps.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disabled by default** for performance reasons. To enable it, pass `'Y'` to the `-sbplog` or `--sbplogwriting` argument.

Each log file is designed to be easily readable and useful for debugging, analysis, or research purposes.
